After that, I began to reach out to developers\n        for help as I realized there was too much to learn and we needed some\n        guidance and help to build our first version of the calculator. Below is\n        a picture of the message I sent out to our developers.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        After I sent this I got a response very quickly from the S9 Consulting\n        Developers and we hopped on a call on Dec 26th. I was impressed with\n        their response time and commitment to work over the holidays. It became\n        apparent very quickly that they would be the first developers we hired\n        to help with our MVP.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        In the call, Carlos Cortez and I discussed what our vision for\n        Forevergreen.earth was and what we could do with the $500 budget. We\n        agreed that the Dev team would fully integrate our current version of\n        the calculator into Wix Velo and add a login system for users to sign in\n        and adjust their data. Carlos sent over the statement of work that day\n        and we got to building.\n      </p>\n      <p style={styles.paragraph}>\n        I also spent a lot of time building out easy-to-follow blogs and\n        documentation of our current version and what we were going for. I\n        published these on our test site as well as the Forevergreen site.

I have been learning a ton about Python and\n        even some HTML (which is how I made this blog).

Welcome to my blog! Super pumped you are reading this and\n        hopefully it can help others learn from my process. My goal for this\n        blog is to document my process of building my first product and a real\n        piece of code. I want to learn along with the progression of this blog\n        to see where I learned, failed, and improved to hopefully maximize my\n        growth.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This first post is exciting as I have no lines of code written! There is\n        much to be done and I am very excited to learn. I have some experience\n        in Java as I learned it last year through an online course and course at\n        Pitt. I am confident I can build my product here and implement it into\n        WIX.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So where am I in the process? Well, it is currently the week before\n        finals, so I will not be able to make much progress this week. That\n        being said, there is much progress to update you on so far, and the next\n        update should be post-finals once I start to code.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Here is the current carbon calculator on our website.{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://www.forevergreen.earth/carbon-calculator\">\n          Carbon Calculator\n        </a>\n      </p>\n      <h2>Screens of the Carbon Calculator</h2>\n      <h3>Screen #1 Onboarding</h3>\n      <img src=\"/assets/screen1.png\" alt=\"Screen #1 Onboarding\" />\n      <h3>Screen #2 Transportation</h3>\n      <img src=\"/assets/screen2.png\" alt=\"Screen #2 Transportation\" />\n      <h3>Screen #3 Diet</h3>\n      <img src=\"/assets/screen3.png\" alt=\"Screen #3 Diet\" />\n      <h3>Screen #4 Energy/Utilities</h3>\n      <img src=\"/assets/screen4.png\" alt=\"Screen #4 Energy/Utilities\" />\n      <h3>Screen #5 Breakdown</h3>\n      <img src=\"/assets/screen5.png\" alt=\"Screen #5 Breakdown\" />\n      <h3>Email Returned to User</h3>\n      <img src=\"/assets/screen6.png\" alt=\"Email Returned to User\" />\n      <p>\n        As you can see the calculator is pretty robust and has a lot of\n        questions. Although the email is very basic, it is a good start and I\n        will learn how to add charts and further links to this through MailChimp\n        or a different email listing service.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        All of this was completed over Thanksgiving Break which was only a week.\n        With a better plan of action and a full month of Christmas, we should\n        have a product/service to track data for users and provide them with\n        connections to solutions. Once I have this MVP finalized we can pass\n        this over to a better-suited development team, and I can focus on other\n        areas.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Thank you for reading! I think this practice will help me a lot in my\n        product development and a great tool for later to catch others up to\n        speed.\n      </p>\n      <Link to=\"/blogs\"
